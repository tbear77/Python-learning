Repo for Python code I am working on

Website Stock Check.py 
Is a tool to watch for changes in website for if an
Item is available or out of stock. 

Future features I am looking to implement would be the
ability to use regex to parse page and automatically find 
the changes when a site updates the availability of stock.
